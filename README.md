# Remote Packet Capture System Using WebSockets in C++

## Objective
Create a remote packet capture application that uses WebSockets to send live packet data from a remote sniffer machine to a central server for real-time viewing on a local machine.

## Overview
This system includes three main components:
1. **Remote Sniffer Application**: Captures network traffic and sends data over a WebSocket connection.
2. **Central Server**: Receives WebSocket connections from sniffer machines and forwards the data.
3. **Local Packet Viewer**: Connects to the server, receives packet data, and pipes it into Wireshark.

## Components

### 1. Remote Sniffer Application (C++)
- **Packet Capture**: Use **libpcap** to sniff network traffic and filter data.
- **WebSocket Transmission**: Use a C++ WebSocket library like **WebSocket++** or **Boost.Beast** to send data to the central server.
- **Program Flow**: Capture packets, serialize data, and transmit via WebSocket.

### 2. Central Server (C++)
- **WebSocket Server**: Use **Boost.Beast** to implement a WebSocket server to receive and forward packet data.
- **Multiple Connections**: Handle multiple sniffer connections.

### 3. Local Packet Viewer (C++)
- **WebSocket Client**: Use **WebSocket++** in C++ to connect to the server and receive data.
- **Wireshark Integration**: Pipe incoming packet data to **Wireshark** for live viewing.

## Implementation Details

### Remote Sniffer Application (C++)
1. **Setup**: Install **libpcap** and a WebSocket library like **WebSocket++** or **Boost.Beast**.
2. **Code Flow**: Initialize libpcap, set packet filters, connect to server, and send captured packets.
3. **Error Handling**: Implement retry logic and buffer packets if the connection is lost.

### Central Server (C++)
1. **Implementation**: Deploy using **Boost.Beast** for WebSocket communication.
2. **Forward Data**: Accept connections and forward packet data in real-time.

### Local Packet Viewer (C++)
1. **Setup**: Implement a WebSocket client in **C++**.
2. **Wireshark Viewing**: Use a pipe or write to a `.pcap` file for Wireshark:
   ```bash
   ./packet_receiver | wireshark -k -i -
   ```

## Considerations
- **Security**: Use **TLS** for encrypted WebSocket communication.
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: Apply packet filtering at the source.
- **Error Handling**: Retry connections and buffer packets during outages.
- **Scalability**: Use message brokers like **Kafka** for scaling.

## Libraries and Tools
- **libpcap**: For packet capturing.
- **WebSocket++** or **Boost.Beast**: For WebSocket communication.
- **Wireshark**: To view live packet data.

## Future Improvements
- **Compression**: Compress packet data to save bandwidth.
- **GUI Application**: Develop a graphical interface for monitoring sniffers.
- **Storage and Analysis**: Store packet captures for historical analysis.
